<!-- Terrell's -->
Hey all, we've got a lot done and still need a few pieces to fall in line. 
I think we still may be strugling with pushing and fetching and organizing who does what. 

I've created a project board to keep track of all the changes we've made and will need to make. 

Head there to see the status of all of the different peices of the project.
